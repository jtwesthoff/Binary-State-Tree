# Binary Search Trees Project

This project implements a Binary Search Tree data structure in Java.

## Description

The Binary Search Tree project includes the following components:

- **BST.java**: This class represents the binary search tree (BST) data structure. It provides methods for inserting, removing, and traversing nodes in the tree.
- **BSTNode.java**: This class represents a node in the binary search tree. It contains data and references to its left and right child nodes.
- **BSTTest.java**: This class contains test cases for the BST data structure, including insertion, removal, and traversal operations.

## Installation

To use the Binary Search Tree project, you need:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jtwesthoff/Binary-State-Tree.git
```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
   - 'BST.java': Contains the implementation of the Binary Search Tree.
   - 'BSTNode.java': Defines the structure of a binary search tree node.
   - 'BSTTest.java': Includes test cases to verify the functionality of the BST.
3. Run the 'BSTTest.java' file to execute the test cases.
